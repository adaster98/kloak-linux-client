Choose one of the pre-made addons or make your own using the template. <br>
Just downoad and copy an addon folder to your own addons folder and restart your client.

On Linux, go to `/home/<YourUsername>/.config/kloak-client/addons` <br>
On Windows, the addons folder is location in `C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\kloak-client\addons`

## Pre-made addons:
**- quick-edit:**<br>
Enables using the up arrow to exit your last sent message.

**- stealth-mode:**<br>
Disabled others from seeing "User is typing..." when your writing your chat essay!


## Info for nerds:

Inside the addon folder, an `addon-states.json` file will generate. This is what stores if an addon is turned on or off.<br>
Each addon is given its own unique folder. And inside will be an index.js and any config files the addon might generate <br>
**NOTE: The addon folder name must be the same as the name defined in index.js**
