- `addon-states.json` is autogenerated and stores if an addon is active or inactive<br>
- Each addon is given its own unique folder. And inside will be an `index.js` <br>
- An addon may generate additional files inside its own folder like a `config.json`<br>
- The addon folder name must be the same as the name defined in `index.js`

Each addon gets a card in the menu with a toggle, tile and description.<br>
You can also choose to have a settings menu, else it will fall back to an information menu.
